Numerous roads\nremain closed due to flooding.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- At 1101 AM CDT /1001 AM MDT/, Snowpack has been soaking into\nthe ground and the upper portions of soils are becoming\nsaturated. Areas that have appreciable snowpack remaining\nwill see additional runoff in the coming days as the ponding\nwater eventually makes its way through frozen culverts and\ninto the waterways. In the Prairie pothole region, ponds and\nsloughs may see water rise enough to run over roads.\nThroughout the warned area, county and township roads may\nbecome covered in water due to high water and plugged\nculverts. Mainly rural areas in the affected counties will be\naffected, but towns and cities may also experience localized\nflooding issues.",

Flows will continue to increase as well,\nespecially on the Menominee.\n\nAdditional precipitation today into early next week will likely bring\nnew and/or continue or enhance ongoing flooding concerns, especially\nfor area rivers that are currently near/at/above flood stage or are\nsusceptible to low-land flooding.\n\nIf you live in or commute through an area that is currently flooding\nor has previously experienced spring melt flooding, expect impacts\nto continue and/or prepare for potential impacts.\n\nThe next update to this outlook is expected by 8:00 AM CDT\nMonday April, 17, 2023.",
